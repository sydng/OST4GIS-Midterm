        <h1>Philadelphia's Litter:<br>A Big Problem for the City</h1>
        <p>One issue that Philadelphia has yet to overcome is the <br>
          garbage that litters its streets. This problem has caught the attention of
          Mayor Kenney, who has pledged to make the <br>city 90% waste and liter free by 2035. In
          preparation of <br>this goal, a litter index of Philadelphia has been created.</p>
        <p>To better understand how this goal will be met, this <br>application aims to answer the following questions:
          <ul>
            <li>Where in Philadelphia are the highest areas of litter?</li>
            <li>On Philadelphia's major arterial streets, how does litter <br>vary?</li>
            <li>Are commercial corridors more likely to be near high <br>litter areas?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>On this page, you can filter data by street type and click on <br>the
          street segements to determine the litter index.</p>
          <select id="sel" type="text">
            <option value="All">All</option>
            <option value="Major Arterial">Major Arterial</option>
            <option value="Minor Arterial">Minor Arterial</option>
            <option value="Collector">Collector</option>
          </select>
        <p>You'll notice that the litter index varies even on streets of <br>the same type.</p>
        <p>The following pages will explore how litter changes along Philadelphia's streets.</p>

        <h1>Philadelphia's Litter:<br>A Big Problem for the City</h1>
        <h3>Streets with A High Litter Index</h3>
        <p>A streets' litter index can range between 1 and 4, with 1 <br>
          being the lowest block score and 4 being the highest. <br>These streets have
          a litter index of greater than 3.</p>
        <p>Streets with a high litter index are pretty well dispersed throughout the city,
          which shows that the litter problem is <br>not any one neighborhood's issue. However,
          there does <br>appear to be a large concentration of streets a  high litter <br>
          index in North Central Philadelphia.</p>

        <h1>Philadelphia's Litter:<br>A Big Problem for the City</h1>
        <h3>Major Arterial Streets with A High Litter Index</h3>
        <p>There are few major arterials in Philadelphia with a high <br>litter index. An arterial road
          is a high capacity road, which <br>most likely has higher speed limits. Therefore, the few
          <br>number of major aterial roads with high litter indexes could <br>be attributed to
          less pedestrian traffic. </p>

        <h1>Philadelphia's Litter:<br>A Big Problem for the City</h1>
        <h3>Collector Streets with A High Litter Index</h3>
        <p>In comparison, there are many more collector streets that <br>have a high litter index.
          This could be the result of two <br>things:
          <ol>
            <li>There are more collector streets, and therefore, by just number alone there are more chances for
              collector <br>streets to have litter</li>
            <li>Collector streets are used to access residential areas. <br>Lack of residential garbage collection -
              i.e. people leaving garbage bags on the sidewalk until pick up - may be contributing to the high
              litter index along these streets.</li>
          </ol>

        <h1>Philadelphia's Litter:<br>A Big Problem for the City</h1>
        <h3>Location of Commercial Corridors</h3>
        <p>While those street segments show streets with high litter in Philadelphia, what about known high traffic areas
          like commercial corridors?</p>
        <p>The map to the right shows the location of commercial <br>corridors in Philadelphia. They are relatively dispersed
          <br>around the city with a higher concentration in Center City.</p>
        <button id="Previous-4">PREVIOUS</button>
        <button id="Next-5">NEXT</button>
      </div>
      <div id="slide-5" style="display: none;">
        <h1>Philadelphia's Litter:<br>A Big Problem for the City</h1>
        <h3>Are more Commercial Corridors near High <br>or Low Litter Indexes?</h3>
        <p>Interestingly, the major arterials and collector streets with a high litter index, occur in areas where commercial
          corridors <br>are more dispersed. Noteably in North and West <br>Philadelphia. This indicates that the concentration of
          people <br>on commercial corridors may not be the only factor that contributes to litter in those areas. There may be an
          <br>underlying neighborhood effect.</p>
